        content: >-
          Digerini™ can offer parents more peace of mind when deciding whether
          their children should have mobile phones. They need the ability to
          monitor at least some of their teen’s electronic activity. Young
          people are vulnerable to online predators and cyber-bullying, both of
          which are growing at an alarming rate. The ease of blocking a number
          and the ability to review the end-of-day call report helps parents
          understand who is trying to contact their children. Another benefit of
          having Digerini™ silence unwanted calls and text messages is that it
          can ensure that the phone itself won’t be a distraction while driving.
          Digerini™ offers a way for parents to add an extra layer of safety to
          their children’s digital experience.

          Digerini™ can help protect the independence of seniors while boosting
          their protection from mobile phone scams. These kinds of phone scams
          are the most commonly used scams against the elderly and can wipe out
          a person’s entire life savings in a matter of minutes. While other
          call screening services simply forward the scammers to voicemail,
          where they can still threaten or confuse the person on the other end
          of the line, Digerini™ can prevent that call or message from ever
          being heard by an unsuspecting senior. Digerini’s intuitive design
          ensures that seniors can set up this protection and include other
          family members or caregivers to help monitor their privacy.

          Busy professionals and executives find it very hard to be productive
          when they are constantly interrupted by their phones. Even a
          two-second interruption in order to see who is calling can disrupt
          concentration, slow down productivity, and increase errors while
          performing a task. They are often forced to silence everything, which
          results in missed connections with clients. Digerini™ solves this
          problem by allowing work calls to continue through while hanging up
          and blocking the potential scam or unwanted calls. This allows reports
          to be finished or emails to be responded to without the frustration of
          being interrupted. Digerini™ gives control back to those that need it
          in their daily schedules.

          Like executives, the productive time of students needs to be
          protected. When unwanted calls interrupt homework or assignments, the
          pull of social media and other apps can turn into an even
          longer-lasting distraction. Simply going into “do not disturb” isn’t
          always an option either as mobile phones often double as an extra
          research device. During class, students are able to focus more without
          their phones vibrating unnecessarily in their pockets. When
          concentration is ruined while learning new concepts, it severely
          diminishes the ability to retain the new information being taught.
          Digerini™ is the perfect student companion to ensure that they are
          able to be successful in class.
